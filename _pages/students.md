## Opportunities for Undergraduates & Master’s Students
- I am currently seeking interested bachelor’s or master’s students at the University of Michigan for a research collaboration with a major semiconductor company. The project focuses on advanced supply chain innovation in the semiconductor industry, leveraging analytical and machine learning methods, and has the potential to lead to a bachelor’s or master’s thesis. The collaboration would require the student to complete an on-site internship in Europe. If you are interested in this opportunity, please feel free to email me.
