I am an Assistant Professor in the Technology and Operations department at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. I received my Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard University in May 2023.

I have broad research interests at the intersection of economics of innovation, technology, digitization, and industrial organization. I use a variety of methods, including reduced-form analysis, machine learning, and structural estimation of empirical decision models. 

Recently, I have been working on research examining the impact of industrial policy on the semiconductor manufacturing industry. You can explore the [Global Semiconductor Industrial Policy Tracker](https://ranzhuo17.github.io/semiconductor_industrial_policy/) that I developed with my student! 

Here is a [link](https://ranzhuo17.github.io/files/RanZhuo_CV_current.pdf) to my CV.
